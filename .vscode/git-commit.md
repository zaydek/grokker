- Always prefix the title with **"ðŸ‘¾ "**
- Use a **title** for simple commits.
- Use a **title** and **body** for complex commits.
  - The length of the commit message should be **proportional to the scope of changes**:
    - For **minor or few changes**, a **title** suffices.
    - For **larger or more involved changes**, include a **body** and/or **enumeration**.
  - In the **body**, use **non-wrapping text**, **enumeration**, or **both**:
    - **Use non-wrapping text** for focused commits (related changes).
    - **Use enumeration** for unfocused commits (unrelated changes), but **only if there is more than one item**.
