1. **Prefix Commits:**
   Prefix commit messages with "ðŸ¤– ".

2. **Commit Title:**
   - Always use a title.
   - Titles should **not** be delimited by a period.

3. **Commit Body:**
   - For simple commits, only use a title.
   - For complex commits, use both a title and a body.
   - If both a title and a body are used, separate them with `\n\n`.
   - The body may contain:
     - A **description** of the changes.
     - **List items** to outline specific updates or steps.
   - The length of the description and list items should be proportional to the scope of changes.

4. **Text Formatting:**
   - Always use **non-wrapping** text in commit messages.
